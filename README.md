# POP-EYE-project
This is a robotic arm autonomously  popping ballons kept over a surface with help of camera attached on the top.
The camera attached above provides the arduino, the position of boundaries and ballons in terms of it's centre co-ordinates and color.
In the arduino code, the 3 angles for 3 different servos gets computed with the help of centre co-ordinates of ballons. The servos trace these 3 angles one by one to exactly reach the position of the balloon and hence the needle attached at arms's end pops the balloon.
